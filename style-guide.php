							<h2>What is a Web Style Guide? <em>This is an h2 element.</em></h2>
							<p>A web style guide is a reference that helps to ensure brand consistency. A complete style guide will establish rules for visual elements of the site, such as typography, brand colors, and page components like buttons and alerts, as well as writing guidelines for voice, tone, etc. This will be a simplified style guide that I will add to as I learn more about building web pages.</p>
